In this project, I am setting up my own version of J.A.R.V.I.S from the Marvel Cinematic Universe  
  
Hardware:
- Raspberry Pi 4B
- A USB microphone
- A USB or audio-jack speaker
  
Software:
- pyaudio
- pocketsphinx

The aim is to transcribe my voice into text, feed it to ChatGPT3, and read out ChatGPT3's response through the speaker.
