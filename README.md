In this project, I have created my own version of J.A.R.V.I.S from the Marvel Cinematic Universe  
  
Hardware:
- Raspberry Pi 4B
- A USB microphone
- A USB or audio-jack speaker
  
Software:
- pyaudio
- speechrecognition
- ChatGPT3 API
- gTTS (Google text-to-speech)
    
By running `src/jarvis.py`, you can say your question aloud into your USB microphone, and Chat-GPT3's answer will be read aloud to you. The program will then terminate.
